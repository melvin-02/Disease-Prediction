                    <h4 class="text-dark">Diabetes</h4>
                    <p>Diabetes is a condition in which your blood glucose, often known as blood sugar, is too high. Your major source of energy is blood glucose, which comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, aids glucose absorption into cells for use as energy. Your body may not produce enough or any insulin, or it may not utilize insulin effectively. Glucose remains in your circulation and does not reach your cells as a result.</p>
